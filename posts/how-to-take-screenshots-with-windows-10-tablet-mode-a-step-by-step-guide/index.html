There are several approaches to take a screenshot in tablet mode, such as using print screen, or other shortcuts that are provided with Windows 10. To take a screenshot on Windows 10 tablet mode, simply press and hold the Windows button on the bottom of the tablet plus the &lsquo;volume down&rsquo; button located at the top of the tablet. Doing so will enable the user to capture whatever is currently being displayed on the screen and copy it to clipboard. The user can then save the screenshot to their device. Taking a screenshot on Windows 10 tablet mode is a simple task that does not require any additional software or hardware, making it an ideal solution for saving and sharing information.</p><h3 id=2-taking-screenshot-in-windows-10-tablet-mode>2.
