Here are some of the best ways to do it:</p><ol><li><p>Using ShareIt: ShareIt is a free app that allows you to quickly transfer files between devices. It is a convenient and easy way to move your WhatsApp chats from one Android phone to another. All you need to do is make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, open ShareIt, and follow the simple instructions to complete the transfer.</p></li><li><p>Using Bluetooth: Bluetooth is another great way to transfer WhatsApp chats. To do this, turn on Bluetooth on both phones, pair them, and then select the chats you want to transfer. When you’re ready, hit send to transfer the files. The process may take a little longer than using ShareIt but it is still a reliable option.</p></li><li><p>Using a PC: By using a PC, you can easily move files between devices. To do this, first connect both phones to the computer and open the WhatsApp folder. Then, copy the chats you want to transfer and paste them into the WhatsApp folder on the other device. Once it’s done, disconnect both phones and everything will be ready.</p></li><li><p>Using an SD Card: If you have large files, you can use an SD card to transfer them. Simply copy the files from the WhatsApp folder onto the SD card, remove the card from the first device, and then insert it into the second device. Then, move the files to the WhatsApp folder on the new device. This is one of the most convenient ways to copy large chats from one device to another.</p></li></ol><p>With these tips and tricks, you can seamlessly move your WhatsApp conversations from one Android device to another without using Google Drive.

In this article, we will discuss the steps that need to be taken to successfully transfer WhatsApp chats from one Android device to another without the help of Google Drive.</p><p>The first step is to make sure that both devices are running the most recent version of WhatsApp. This is because the process of transferring chats relies on the latest features of the app. Once both devices are updated, users need to open WhatsApp from the device they wish to transfer the chats from.

Users should select &lsquo;Through USB&rsquo; to transfer chats without the help of Google Drive. After making this selection, the user will be asked to select the device they wish to transfer the chats to.</p><p>Once the transfer process is initiated, the user should wait until the chat has been copied. The transfer process may take a few minutes so users should be patient while the transfer takes place. When the transfer is complete, users should check the new device to see if the chats have been successfully transferred. By following these steps, users can easily transfer their WhatsApp chats from one device to another without the help of Google Drive.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdGTKoe6haI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How can I move WhatsApp chats from Android to Android without having to use Google Drive?
