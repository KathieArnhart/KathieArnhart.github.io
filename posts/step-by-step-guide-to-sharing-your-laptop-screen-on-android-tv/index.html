Test to Make Sure the Screen is Shared Successfully<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-test-to-make-sure-the-screen-is-shared-successfully>#</a></h2><p>Sharing your laptop screen on Android TV can be easy with just a few simple steps. The first step is to make sure your laptop and the Android TV device are connected to the same network. Then, open the Settings menu on your laptop and select the option to share its screen to the connected Android TV device. After that, open the Google Home app on your Android TV device and select the Cast Screen or Audio option. You can then select the device to which you want to share your laptop screen. Finally, it&rsquo;s essential to test if the laptop&rsquo;s screen is being shared successfully on your Android TV device. Make sure that all the media on your laptop is viewable on the Android TV device. And that&rsquo;s it. You can start enjoying watching movies, series, or any media content on your big screen now.</p><h3 id=1-share-laptop-screen-on-android-tv>1. Share Laptop Screen on Android TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-share-laptop-screen-on-android-tv>#</a></h3><p>After connecting your laptop to the Android TV, the next step is to test whether the laptop screen is shared successfully. The process includes checking if the laptop is connected to the same network as the Android TV. To check the connection, open the settings on your laptop and look for the network section. If the laptop is connected to the same network the connection should be good.</p><p>The next step is to try and share the laptop screen with the Android TV. To do this, open the screen sharing app on the laptop and select the Android TV as the device you want to share. Select the share option and try to view the laptop screen on the Android TV.</p><p>Another way to test the connection is to go into the media streaming settings on the laptop and see if the Android TV is listed as a streaming device. If it is, then the laptop is successfully connected to the Android TV.</p><p>The final way to test the screen sharing is to view a video on the laptop and see if it plays on the Android TV. If it does, then the screen has been shared successfully. This is the best way to make sure the screen is shared properly.</p><h3 id=2-test-shared-screen-success>2. Test Shared Screen Success<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-test-shared-screen-success>#</a></h3><p>Once you have successfully casted your laptop’s screen to your Android TV, you still need to validate that you have done the job right. To test this, you can play any video or audio file on your laptop. If the media plays on the Android TV, that means you have successfully shared your laptop’s screen with the TV. You can also check by minimizing and then enlarging the laptop’s screen. If the screen size changes, then it is a sure indication that the two displays are connected. If the TV is not playing the audio or video, then it means there is a problem and you need to check the connecting cables or reboot the devices to establish the connection.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6NEkJzFIS4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a step-by-step guide to sharing your laptop screen on Android TV?
