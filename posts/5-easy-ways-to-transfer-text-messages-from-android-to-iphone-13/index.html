It is important to note that you will need to re-enter contacts from Android into iPhone 13 in order for these messages to display correctly. Additionally, if you have stored media, such as photos and videos, in the texts, you will need to transfer these items manually.</p><p>Finally, when transferring text messages from Android to iPhone 13, it is recommended to back up your Android device first. This will allow you to restore all of your content if something goes wrong. It is also important to remember that when transferring text messages, the text will appear differently on iPhone 13 than it did on Android.</p><p>By following these simple steps, you can easily transfer your text messages from Android to iPhone 13. With the right app, you can be sure that all of your text messages are safely transferred to your new iPhone.</p><h3 id=3-important-notes-and-suggestions-1>3.
