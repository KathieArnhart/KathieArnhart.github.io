What is Emergency Call on Android?
A1. Emergency Call on Android is a feature that allows users to unlock their phones with a certain password when they are unable to remember the existing password.

A2. To use the Emergency Call feature on Android, you must have an Android phone and have an existing phone number associated with it. You must also have a password set up for the phone, as Emergency Call will not work without one.</p><p>Q3. How do I use Emergency Call on Android?
A3. To use the Emergency Call feature on Android, you will first need to open the “Phone” application on your Android phone. From there, you will need to select the “Emergency Call” icon located at the bottom-left of the app. You will then need to enter the correct password to access the Emergency Call option. Once you are in the Emergency Call option, you will be required to enter your phone number and press the “Send” button to contact the local operator.</p><p>Q4. Is there any other way to unlock my phone password?
A4. Yes, there are several other ways to unlock your phone password.
