Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#iii-conclusion>#</a></h3><p>Scanning images on an Android phone requires a few steps. Firstly, open the camera app and switch on the scanner setting, sometimes indicated as ‘Scanner’ or ‘Scan’. Align the image you want to scan before taking a picture. After taking the picture, the camera app should provide options to crop and adjust the image to enhance the result. Depending on the model of phone, the user might be able to adjust the image quality and level of details. If the camera app does not have the options, a third-party scanning app can be downloaded to adjust the image. Once the adjustment is done, the scanner can save the image as a pdf, jpg, or any other file format of choice. Finally, file the image in a designated folder for easy access later.</p><h2 id=iii-after-youre-done>III.

Start by tapping the checkmark icon at the top right corner of the screen. This will open a confirmation window where you can name and save your image to the desired folder. From there, you can easily access it in your photo album or send it to other devices. If you are satisfied with your work, don&rsquo;t forget to tap the save icon to keep your image safe.

These apps allow you to store and sync your scans with online cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive.
