If so, you’re not alone! With the recent AirPods Max release, many people are curious if these wireless headphones are compatible with their Android device. We’ve got the answers you need to know. Keep reading to find out all the details! Are you an Android user eager to get your hands on Apple’s new AirPods Max? You might be wondering if these premium wireless headphones will work with your smartphone. Well, the good news is that Apple’s AirPods Max does indeed work with Android devices. However, there are a few things you need to consider before making the switch, and we’re here to help.\nIf you’re considering buying AirPods Max, you’ll be able to enjoy the same great sound quality and functionality you’d expect from Apple’s premium audio technology. You’ll also receive access to the same range of features, including active noise cancellation and voice recognition capabilities. However, you’ll need to make sure you’re using an Android device running Marshmallow or later. Additionally, you may need to download an Apple Music app from the Google Play Store in order to access all of the features.\nMoreover, you won’t be able to take advantage of features like Audio Sharing and Spatial Audio, as these are exclusive to Apple’s operating system. Furthermore, there are certain features exclusive to iOS, such as automatically switching between devices, that you’ll miss out on if you’re using AirPods Max with an Android device.\nSo, there you have it – the answer to the question of whether or not AirPods Max work with Android. If you’re considering making the switch to Apple’s latest audio offering, it’s worth considering all the factors we’ve discussed here before making your decision.\nAccording to the Apple Support, AirPods Max aren’t compatible with Android devices, since they are designed exclusively for Apple devices. “AirPods Max are Apple devices designed to work exclusively with iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, and Mac. They are not compatible with Android devices.”\nHowever, there are some third-party apps available, which can be used to stream audio from Android devices to AirPods Max. According to a report by The Verge, “These third-party apps use a Bluetooth connection to stream audio from an Android device to AirPods Max, allowing users to listen to music, podcasts, and more from their phone. While not a perfect solution, it should provide some level of functionality for Android users who already own the pricey headphones.”\nAdditionally, a survey by Statista suggests that Apple dominates the market for headphone sales, with 79.1% of US online shoppers buying Apple headphones in 2020. This stat indicates that AirPods Max has a huge potential user base among Apple device owners in the US.\n1.
