With this easy-to-follow guide, you’ll be able to access all of your conversations, photos, videos, and more in no time. Start restoring WhatsApp from your Android to your iPhone today and experience the difference!\nAccording to a survey conducted by Statista in 2019, about 2.6 billion people worldwide use WhatsApp, making it one of the most popular social media platforms.\nRestoring WhatsApp from an Android device to an iPhone is a relatively easy process, as long as it is done correctly. TechRadar says, “Thanks to the deep integration of WhatsApp into Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, the process is quite painless if you follow the guide below.”\nPaul Lavelle, an expert on mobile technology, states, “Using WhatsApp on an iPhone and Android at the same time can be a challenge, so having the right step-by-step guide in place ensures that users can switch between the two platforms quickly and without any hiccups.”\n1. How to Transfer from Android to iPhone 13 Restoring WhatsApp from an Android to an iPhone 13 can be intimidating for users who are switching from one platform to another. Thankfully, for users who want to transfer all their WhatsApp conversations, WhatsApp does offer a few options. This step-by-step guide will outline the process of restoring WhatsApp from an Android to an iPhone 13.\nFirst, the user will need to back up their current conversations on their Android device to their Google Drive. To do this, open WhatsApp and select ‘Settings’, then ‘Chats’ and ‘Chat Backup’. Select ‘Back up’ and it will begin to save your conversations to your Google Drive.\nOnce the back up is completed, the user can begin transferring their WhatsApp conversations to their iPhone 13. To do this, the user should first download and install their WhatsApp app onto the iPhone 13. If the user already had the app installed on their Android device, their account will transfer automatically.\nNext, the user can restore their WhatsApp conversations from their Google Drive to their iPhone 13. To do this, the user needs to select ‘Restore Chat History’ in the WhatsApp setup window, then ‘Restore from Google Drive’. Select the most recent backup and the application will start downloading the conversations in the background.\nFinally, the user will need to wait for the conversations to fully restore on their iPhone 13. After the app is done downloading the conversations, it should state ‘Your chats have been restored from Google Drive’. This will confirm that the transfer is complete and the user should now be able to view their conversations on their iPhone 13.\nA.

Step 7: Paste the “msgstore.db.crypt” file that you previously copied into the “WhatsApp/Databases” folder on the root of your iPhone. Step 8: Once the file is pasted, WhatsApp should recognize the file and generate a prompt asking if you want to restore the messages.
