Understanding How to Unlock Your Screen<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-understanding-how-to-unlock-your-screen>#</a></h3><p>Modern Android phones are designed with rotating screens as a basic feature. This enables you to use your phone in either a vertical or horizontal orientation. If your Samsung device&rsquo;s screen doesn&rsquo;t rotate, you should try to unlock it. To do this, go to your device&rsquo;s “Settings” menu. In the “Display” section, look for the “Screen rotation” option and switch it to “on”. This should enable the rotation option for your Samsung device. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, you may need to restart your phone or reinstall any apps that may have disabled the screen rotation. Additionally, some apps like YouTube, Google Maps and Facebook might not be able to rotate the screen. To turn the rotation option on for each of these apps, you should go to each individual app’s settings. Lastly, you may need to calibrate the phone’s accelerometer which measures the tilt of the phone and thus determines how the screen should rotate. To do this, go to your Samsung device’s “Settings” menu, then “Motion”, and find the “ gyroscope calibration” option and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><h3 id=2-rotating-the-screen-on-your-samsung-android-phone>2.
