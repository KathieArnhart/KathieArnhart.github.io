Using File Sharing Apps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-using-file-sharing-apps>#</a></h3><p>When it comes to transferring data from Android to another Android phone, there are a few different ways to do it. One of the most common methods is via Bluetooth. This requires both devices to have Bluetooth enabled and to be within range of each other. Another method is through using a USB cable, which is often included with many Android devices. Simply connect the two phones together and you will be able to transfer your data. Thirdly, you can use a cloud storage system such as Google Drive or Dropbox to store your data and access it on either device. Lastly, there are a number of third-party apps that allow you to transfer data between devices. These apps require both users to have the app installed on their device in order to be able to share the data.
